    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Technical Lead for the FISMA Compliance System (FCS) Project.  Duties included the evaluation and analysis of several software titles to satisfy business requirements required by the Cyber Security organization for Federal Information Standards.  Worked with RSA Archer (selected software title) vendor representative to develop the System Design Specification (SDS) in planning, to prepare for software implementation in our development, test and production environments.  Orally communicated information to Cyber Security, Networking, Storage, Database, and Server teams regarding preliminary technical requirements identified in the SDS to assess our capabilities within our environment.  Provided feedback to the vendor and adjusted the documentation accordingly. Orally communicated, to individuals (business users) of the Cyber Security organization, concern, using sound judgement, regarding the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) categorization because of the data that will be stored in the system.  After evaluation alternatives for all data collection requirements and information, I made the recommendation to increase the FIPS categorization to HIGH, which added necessary risk to the project. Identifying the risk early and adjusting requirements early in planning, helped the project team understand the adjusted requirements, additional resources and costs needed in order to successfully install the platform during the execution phase.  Created the System Security Plan and Privacy Information Assessment for the software platform.  Coordinated meetings with required individuals and groups to orally communicate needed information to successfully plan for the optimization of the system functionality to ensure consistency with Federal Information Security Management Standards.  Provided supplemental information via handouts and assigned tasks to Cyber Security resources for data evaluation and collection. </li>
        <li>Technical Lead for the ALM 11 to TFS 2015 Migration Project.  The purpose of the project was not only to migrate data but to retire an aging, out of support, ALM application.  Duties included working with the ALM 11 and TFS 2015 system administrator, business analyst and QA Analyst to coordinate, develop and schedule the migration of identified ALM artifacts to TFS 2015.  This included analyzing and developing software tests to evaluate the pre and post migration state of the ALM information in TFS.  Worked with business users in testing to evaluate the information and come up with a migration strategy to accommodate all users of ALM successfully.  Orally communicated to individuals of the project team, ideas to improve and adjust our migration strategy such as having daily 15-minute standups and retrospectives after each migration. This allowed the team to quickly solve problems, identify roadblocks and gauge non-verbal cues from project team members and outside invitees in execution.  This helped the project team respond accordingly and mitigate appropriately.  Orally communicated controversial information regarding several hindrances and roadblocks that required additional support and communication from the Project Sponsors which helped the project execution phase to move further along. Successfully monitored and closed the project on schedule.</li>
        <li>Technical Lead for Team Foundation Server Standards development.  The effort is to standardize and normalize the use of TFS amongst the non-critical software development teams within the Software Development and Operations organization.  Scheduled joint meetings with identified SMEs per organization to express information and guidance for TFS standardization. Listened to others and responded appropriately to concerns and questions regarding training, exposing functionality and therefore made decisions regarding items on the meeting agenda.  Assigned action items to resources regarding tasks and follow up items for the standardization effort.  Provided supplemental information which included graphs and workflow diagrams that explained the licensing model, the permissions and groups and the AGILE template workflow.  Created TFS 2015 User Group site to capture and share information and standards that were agreed upon by the collective group and implemented by the TFS 2015 Administrator. </li>
        <li>Subject Matter Expert and Technical Resource for the JAMA Cloud migration.  Worked with external vendor and BPA Contour system administrator to capture and evaluate requirements needed to move and upgrade our Contour (JAMA) implementation to the cloud.  Was the Subject Matter Expert for the system integration between Contour and another application called Project, Program and Portfolio Management System (HP PPM).  Developed, customized and implemented a tool based on the business requirements by the PMO office and associated business analyst to flag the health status of projects in Contour based on an algorithm created by the business.  This tool was designed, developed and tested in the development, test and production environments.  The tool implemented operations of the JAMA Contour API to capture project data artifacts necessary to calculate the correct health assessment.  The flagged health status was then updated to a database in HP PPM, which updated the health status for all projects in HP PPM.  During the cloud migration, I successfully tested the new REST API via PowerShell and validated the integration between the cloud JAMA implementation and or on-prem HP PPM installation.  After oral communication and review between the technical team and the business organization, it was determined that the need for the integration was no longer needed as a requirement therefore as an appropriate response, the integration was removed from scope. The Contour to JAMA cloud migration was executed, monitored, and closed successfully. </li>
        <li>Solved problems regarding security and patch issues that pertained to the internal Project and SharePoint farms.  The patching at the time was not automated due to miscommunication and limited resources.  Therefore, I lead, created, made recommendations and documented a manual patching strategy and schedule and strategy for the JSI SharePoint and Project Server farm administrators.  After receiving feedback and adjusting, the plan was put into action and the systems were brought into compliance with the rest of our IT systems.  This executed plan enabled the Business Applications Support organization to be in sync with the latest patches in order to mitigate security vulnerabilities in the internal and external farms.</li>
        <li>Worked with contracted 3rd party support vendor to conduct an onsite health assessment for the BPA SharePoint intranet.  Orally communicated non-classified, appropriate information to assist the vendor in understanding what was needed in the assessment. Provided supplemental information in the form of spreadsheets and diagrams to further the understanding of the systems being discussed.</li>
        <li>Created AGILE change management strategy for the iterative development done during the Customer Portal application enhancement and break-fix contract.  The problem that existed was the admins nor the developers had an efficient rollback strategy for functionality that was being deployed.  The contract was structured where the functionality packages should be able to work independently of each other and should not be dependent.  Therefore, I generated, presented an alternative, and made the recommendation to implement my change management strategy and methods which allowed for effective rollback strategies and package independence via PowerShell scripts.  This eliminated the need for using backup/restore/rebuild strategies that were in place by our onsite SharePoint Administrator.  This also eliminated the need to wait several days until a working environment was available to customers.</li>
        <li>Worked with management and the SharePoint team on the Enterprise Technology Assessment Survey.  Communicated orally, assessed, and evaluated the system design for the survey.  The problem was 2-fold. The expected turnaround time for the survey was fairly quick and the initial design of the survey made it virtually impossible to fill out due to the long nature of the questions and limitations of InfoPath. Therefore, I coordinated a meeting with the resources assigned to the task and held a brainstorming white board session to design a more efficient that would satisfy the reporting requirements while also making the form more tolerable for users to fill out.  I then designed and developed backend C# code that would support the design and allow for data to be collected correctly for accurate reporting.  Went through multiple rounds of analysis, software testing and evaluation and was able to meet the tight deadline. The survey rollout was a success and provided valuable feedback to the CIO and other supporting managers.</li>
        <li>Worked cross functionally to successfully migrate the PeopleSoft HRMIS enterprise application to the new data center.  HRMIS integrates with the Workflow Connection business process workflows via the HRMIS WCF Service.  Worked with the HRMIS technical team and business users to validate data synchronization and integration points on the PeopleSoft HRMIS application.
            <ul>
                <li>Solved multiple problems on the PeopleSoft HRMIS application through troubleshooting where the PeopleSoft HRMIS software was generating invalid namespaces for the methods/operations which caused integration failures in the development and test environments for the Business Applications HRMIS WCF service. Used Visual Studio 2012 IDE to run unit tests on the HRMIS WCF service operations to review the data package being delivered from the PeopleSoft HRMIS web service that is owned by the Enterprise Applications organizations to the HRMIS WCF service which is owned by the Business Applications organization.  Then I presented, orally, factual information to the technical resource of the Enterprise Applications organization and continued to work collaboratively until the problem was fixed.  During our engagements I would provide supplemental information like application logs, unit tests results, and custom application exception definitions.  The resolution of this problem was critical because the project team and the HRMIS team was unable to move to production had this issue not been resolved.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Provided technical expertise for the public facing Science Bowl Volunteer web form for the new Science Bowl Sign up Process.  Worked with Public Affairs to gather requirements and update the form for the upcoming season.  In addition, solved a problem to make the form printable and readable via email which was considered a pre-existing issue/defect for several years.  I was able to work with Public Affairs in order to provide this functionality which eliminated lots of rework for the business.</li>
        <li>Technical Lead and Subject Matter Expert for the Unstructured Data Management Project (now called Discovery Core System or DCS) to assist in the evaluation, planning, configuration, implementation, and support of the HP IDOL (Autonomy) enterprise software and all additional modules for records management, legal holds, e-Discovery, and search.  Duties included partnering with the HP vendor and BPA Project team to provide technical expertise, analysis, evaluation of software applicability to non-functional requirements in the BPA environment, information collection for document management systems, mail server (Exchange), integrated systems (SharePoint repositories), and  file systems; development of the system security plan to ensure consistency with the Federal Information Security Management Standards, the configuration management plan, the operations and maintenance plan; the planning and coordination of software builds and releases through the development, build, test and production environments which involves the HP Vendor, multiple upstream support system support organization liaisons and contacts, quality and production control.  Worked with the HP Vendor to solve problems with the indexing taking too long.  Reviewed logs and made recommendations to improve performance during the execution phase of the project.</li>
        <li>Solved post go-live problems with the DCS System regarding indexing of content failing after gathering data for several weeks.  Coordinated effort that included SharePoint and Project Server Administrators, the SQL database team, and the DCS support team (known as MicroFocus) to modify and change the patching schedule in order to successfully index intranet content.</li>
        <li>Worked with Login Remediation Project (also known as LOIDR) team to schedule and coordinate updates to COTS systems and in-house developed applications to remove invalid user ids.  A problem existed where the LOIDR project team’s database scripts would not work with certain SharePoint, Project Server, and K2 Blackpearl software systems owned by Business Applications Support.  Therefore, after listening to feedback from the project team and the system administrators, I designed, developed, and created PowerShell scripts which invoked web service operations within the COTS systems’ APIs and used LOIDR database data to update login ids across these multiple applications.</li>
        <li>Provided technical expertise and support for 10+ applications during the IT Virtualization and Consolidation (IVC) project.  Duties include upgrading several applications to meet the expected standards which include but is not limited to implementing SSL protocol on several services and applications, integration between legacy (yet-to-be-migrated) and current downstream systems, upgrading applications to the latest available platforms (SharePoint 2007 applications upgraded to SharePoint 2010 applications prior to the migration), performing system testing and evaluation between the new IVC environment and the legacy environment for data validation and data integrity checks, and developing build plans for all systems from development, build, test, and production.</li>
        <li>Technical lead for the Project, Program and Portfolio Management Project also known as HP PPM.  Duties included the evaluation and assessment of several software packages to identify their applicability to the established functional and non-functional requirements.  Worked with the BPA System Administrator and the HP Vendor to coordinate working sessions for installing the software package in the development, test and productions environments.  Designed and developed application to integrate the HP PPM with BPA’s implementation of JAMA Contour which housed project requirements data.  Participated in lessons learned prior to project closing to orally communicate constructive technical and controversial feedback on multiple issues that occurred throughout the project like lack of documentation from the vendor and burdensome requirements that were approved via change management during execution that would greatly affect the system owners in operations and maintenance.</li>
        <li>Technical lead for the Real Property Services/Terrain project.  Worked with 3rd party vendor and BPA business analysts to provide technical information regarding the SharePoint farm and coordinated releases between the development, test and production environments.  Post project, I communicated orally to an audience consisting of the vendor, Business Applications Support system administrators and analysts and provided controversial feedback at the lessons learned meeting.  The project had multiple problems during execution, and was way over schedule. The problems occurred because the requirements changed constantly and there was no change management done by the Project Manager on the BPA side or the vendor side.  Additionally, there were no assigned QA Analyst resources so therefore testing was done solely by the business users.  The development for the vendor accepted all changes coming from the client without signed approval which created an inefficient and broken system that never met the needs of the client.  Lastly, the communication with the BPA technical team was slim which further caused issues during deployments and change control.  The project was successful on paper but was not successful in terms of providing a working solution, exceptional customer service or meeting the needs of our clients.</li>
        <li>Technical lead and project manager for the Workflow Connection upgrade expense project. Duties included the product evaluation of Metastorm BPM 9 and K2 Blackpearl 4.6.2.  Created the work breakdown structure for each upgrade path, created the project timeline, the cost benefit analysis per system, resource planning, team building, sprint planning, system testing, problem solving, release management, and written/oral communications between management, team members, customers, testers, service providers and the help desk.</li>
        <li>Provided SharePoint portal/site administration support and customer service for all organizations within BPA.</li>
        <li>Provided on-call support for SharePoint servers and applications associated with MOSS 2007</li>
        <li>Evaluated and assessed workflow software packages Nintex and K2 Blackpearl for customer workflows and automated business processes</li>
        <li>Planned, designed, architected and implemented branding for the SharePoint 2010 intranet upgrade.  Tested branding design against 508 compliant and accessibility requirements and standards.</li>
